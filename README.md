# 5GTANGO Descriptor Generator
The descriptor generator provides a simple web-based GUI that allows to setup and generate correct descriptors (VNFDs and NSDs). The generator uses provided information or assumes default values if no information is provided. This allows the generation of descriptors with a single click.

The resulting VNFDs and NSDs can still be modified as needed.



The current version is just a simple prototype to test the main functionality. Better visualization and more/better features are needed.
